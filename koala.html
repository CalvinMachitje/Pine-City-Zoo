                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
    <p>Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are marsupials native to Australia, often mistaken for bears. They weigh 4 to 15 kg (9 to 33 lb) and have thick gray fur with large, fluffy ears. Koalas spend most of their lives in eucalyptus trees.</p>
                         
    <p>They are strict herbivores, feeding exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients, so they sleep up to 20 hours a day to conserve energy. Koalas are solitary but may share overlapping territories.</p>
                           
   <p>Koalas are found in eucalyptus forests and woodlands along the eastern and southeastern coasts of Australia.</p>
                           
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the koalas at enclosure K6, in the eucalyptus grove.</p>
