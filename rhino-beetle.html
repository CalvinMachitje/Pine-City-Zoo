                            <h3>RHINO-BEETLE</h3>
    <p>Rhinoceros beetles (family Scarabaeidae, subfamily Dynastinae) are large insects known for the horn-like structures on their heads, resembling a rhinoceros. They can grow up to 6 cm (2.4 in) long and are among the strongest animals relative to their size, capable of lifting 850 times their own weight.</p>
                         
    <p>These beetles are primarily nocturnal and feed on decaying wood, sap, and fruit. Males use their horns to fight over mates. Despite their intimidating appearance, they are harmless to humans.</p>
                           
   <p>Rhinoceros beetles are found in tropical and subtropical forests, often in areas with plenty of decaying logs and vegetation.</p>
                           
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the rhinoceros beetles at exhibit I9, in the insect house.</p>
