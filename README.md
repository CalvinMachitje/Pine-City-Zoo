FNB App Academy programme

The Pine City Zoo project is a hands-on, practical application developed as part of the FNB App Academy 2025, a free, online coding programme offered by First National Bank (FNB). This initiative is designed to empower young people across South Africa and other African countries with in-demand tech skills, equipping them for careers in the digital economy. The Pine City Zoo project serves as a core component of the academy's curriculum, providing participants with real-world experience in app development using modern tools and frameworks.
