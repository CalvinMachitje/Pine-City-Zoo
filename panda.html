                            <h3>PANDA</h3>
    <p>Giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are beloved bears native to China, known for their black-and-white fur. They typically weigh 70 to 120 kg (154 to 264 lb). Despite being carnivores by classification, pandas have a diet that is 99% bamboo.</p>
                         
    <p>Pandas are solitary animals, spending most of their time eating or resting. They have a pseudo-thumb, an elongated wrist bone, which helps them grasp bamboo. Pandas are endangered, with conservation efforts ongoing to protect them.</p>
                           
   <p>They live in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests with dense bamboo undergrowth, typically at elevations between 1,200 to 3,400 m (4,000 to 11,000 ft).</p>
                           
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the pandas at pen P2, in the bamboo forest exhibit.</p>
