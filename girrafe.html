                            <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
    <p>Giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are the tallest land animals, reaching heights of up to 5.5 m (18 ft). They are native to Africa and are easily recognized by their long necks, spotted coat, and horn-like ossicones. Giraffes can weigh between 800 to 1,200 kg (1,760 to 2,640 lb).</p>
                         
    <p>They are herbivores, feeding primarily on acacia leaves, using their long tongues to strip leaves from thorny branches. Giraffes live in small herds and use their height to spot predators like lions from a distance.</p>
                           
   <p>Giraffes are found in savannahs and woodlands, where they can access tall trees and open spaces to roam.</p>
                           
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen G7, in the savannah heights area.</p>
