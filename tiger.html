                            <h3>TIGER</h3>
    <p>Tigers (Panthera tigris) are the largest members of the cat family, Felidae, and are renowned for their striking orange coat with black stripes. They can weigh up to 300 kg (660 lb) and measure up to 3.9 m (13 ft) in length, including their tail. Tigers are apex predators, primarily hunting ungulates like deer and wild boar..</p>
                         
    <p>These solitary animals are territorial and use their powerful jaws and claws to take down prey. Tigers are also excellent swimmers and often cool off in rivers or lakes. Sadly, they are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.</p>
                           
   <p>Tigers inhabit a variety of environments, including tropical rainforests, grasslands, and swamps, often near water sources.</p>
                           
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the tigers at pen C3, near the waterfall overlook.</p>
