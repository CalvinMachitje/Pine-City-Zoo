    <p>The dusky leaf monkey (Trachypithecus obscurus), also known as the spectacled langur, is a primate species found in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Thailand, and Myanmar. They are characterized by their dark gray fur, lighter underparts, and distinctive white rings around their eyes, giving them a spectacled appearance. Adults typically weigh 6 to 9 kg (13 to 20 lb).</p>
                         
    <p>These monkeys are arboreal, spending most of their time in trees. They are folivores, with a diet mainly consisting of leaves, though they also eat fruits and flowers. Dusky leaf monkeys live in small groups led by a dominant male and are known for their loud vocalizations.</p>
                           
   <p>They prefer dense rainforests and forested hills, where they can find ample foliage and protection from predators like leopards and eagles.</p>
                           
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
