                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
    <p>Gorillas (genus Gorilla) are the largest primates, native to the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. Males, known as silverbacks, can weigh up to 180 kg (400 lb) and stand up to 1.8 m (5.9 ft) tall. Gorillas have robust builds and dark fur.</p>
                         
    <p>They live in family groups led by a dominant silverback and are primarily herbivorous, eating leaves, stems, and fruits. Gorillas are known for their social behavior and use of tools in the wild.</p>
                           
   <p>Gorillas inhabit dense rainforests and mountainous regions, often at elevations up to 4,000 m (13,000 ft).</p>
                           
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gorillas at enclosure F4, in the forest highlands area.</p>
