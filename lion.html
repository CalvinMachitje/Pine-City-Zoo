                            <h3>LION</h3>
    <p>Lions (Panthera leo) are majestic big cats known as the "king of the jungle." Males can weigh up to 250 kg (550 lb) and are distinguished by their thick manes. Lions are social animals, living in prides consisting of related females, their cubs, and a few males.</p>
                         
    <p>They are apex predators, hunting animals like zebras and wildebeests. Lions are known for their powerful roars, which can be heard up to 8 km (5 miles) away. They rest for up to 20 hours a day, often in the shade.</p>
                           
   <p>Lions prefer grassy plains and savannahs but can also be found in woodlands and semi-deserts</p>
                           
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the lions at pen L1, near the central savannah exhibit.</p>
