                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p>The gemsbok (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi) is an antelope native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Bovidae and is closely related to the bontebok. Blesboks are known for their distinctive white face and reddish-brown coat, with a lighter underbelly. They can weigh between 55 to 80 kg (121 to 176 lb) and stand about 85 to 100 cm (33 to 39 in) at the shoulder.</p>
                         
    <p>These antelopes are grazers, primarily feeding on short grasses, and are often seen in herds. Their horns, which both males and females possess, are lyre-shaped and can grow up to 35 cm (14 in) long. Blesboks are swift runners, capable of reaching speeds up to 70 km/h (43 mph) to escape predators like lions and hyenas.</p>
                           
   <p>gemsboks thrive in open grasslands and savannahs, particularly in regions with seasonal rainfall where they can find fresh grass after the rains.</p>
                           
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the blesboks at pen S12, near the southern grasslands exhibit.</p>
