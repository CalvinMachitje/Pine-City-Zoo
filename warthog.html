                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>Warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) are wild pigs native to Africa, known for their distinctive facial warts and curved tusks. They weigh between 50 to 150 kg (110 to 330 lb) and have bristly hair covering their bodies.</p>
                         
    <p>They are omnivores, feeding on grasses, roots, and small animals. Warthogs are known for kneeling on their front knees to graze and can run at speeds up to 48 km/h (30 mph) to escape predators like lions.</p>
                           
   <p>Warthogs prefer savannahs and grasslands, often near waterholes and wallows where they can cool off.</p>
                           
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the warthogs at pen W8, near the muddy plains exhibit.</p>
